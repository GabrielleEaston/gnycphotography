        Native of Concepción, at the age of fifteen Gonzalo discovered a strong
        love for music and joined a band with his cousins. Later he got
        interested in sculpture, particulary working with waste materials. When
        he entered the career of Engineering at the Bio Bio University, he
        participated in his first photography workshop with the Master Andres
        Latini Lanata; in that workshop he found the way to unite his múltiple
        interests. Without any hesitation Gonzalo Came to Santiago to study at
        the Pontificia Catholic University of Chile and later the United States,
        where he studied art, photography and film.

        His photographs focus mainly on people who live marginal lives to the
        paradigms proposed by mainstream culture. They carry a mind of their
        own, and captivate the viewer through a succesful use of light and
        shadow,revealing what he/she is unable to see. Admirer of the work of
        French photographers Robert Doisneau and Henri Cartier Bresson, with
        whom he feels very identified with, and also has total respect for the
        technical of the American photographer, Ansel Adams.{" "}
